## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added 
- Register information request
```
mmc.info.Request.Track.register_x
mmc.info.Request.Track.register_y
mmc.info.Request.Track.register_ww
mmc.info.Request.Track.register_wr
```

- Register information response
```
mmc.info.Response.Line.register_x
mmc.info.Response.Line.register_y
mmc.info.Response.Line.register_ww
mmc.info.Response.Line.register_wr
```
```
mmc.info.Response.Line.Register.driver
mmc.info.Response.Line.Register.value
```

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Release command structure  
Removed:
```
mmc.command.Request.Release.target
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.command.Request.Release.drivers
```
Release command releases every carrier on the selected driver.

- **BREAKING:** Push command structure  
Removed: 
```
mmc.command.Request.Push.carrier
mmc.info.Response.Line.Carrier.State.waiting_push
```
Push axis does not wait for a carrier to arrive. Push applies only when there is a carrier on the pushing axis.

- **BREAKING:** Pull command structure  
Removed: 
```
mmc.command.Request.Pull.transition
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.command.Request.Pull.location
```

- **BREAKING:** Acceleration and Velocity values have to be provided in percent 
```
mmc.command.Request.Move.velocity
mmc.command.Request.Move.acceleration
mmc.command.Request.Push.velocity
mmc.command.Request.Push.acceleration
mmc.command.Request.Pull.velocity
mmc.command.Request.Pull.acceleration

```

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed commands  
Removed: 
```
mmc.command.Request.set_zero
mmc.command.Request.stop_push
```
The zero-point is set after using the `calibrate` command.  
Push only works now when there is a carrier on the pushing axis. 


- **BREAKING:** Removed support for CAS  
Removed: 
```
mmc.command.Request.Move.disable_cas
mmc.command.Request.Pull.Transition.disable_cas
mmc.info.Response.Line.Carrier.State.cas_disabled
mmc.info.Response.Line.Carrier.State.cas_triggered
```

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Track configuration returns `drivers` of a line as array of `Response.TrackConfig.Driver` instead of number of drivers in a line

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Allow sending multiple `push` and `move` commands at once using `group` command
- Upgrade zig version to zig 0.16.0

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- API documentation
- Carrier validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Ability to retrieve all track information without specifying a Line ID  
Removed:
```
mmc.info.Request.Track.line
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.info.Request.Track.lines
```

- **BREAKING:** Track info response structure updated  
Removed:
```
mmc.info.Response.Track.line 
mmc.info.Response.Line.line
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.info.Response.Track.lines
mmc.info.Response.Line.id
```

- **BREAKING:** `velocity` and `acceleration` behaviour  
Changed unit from `dm/s` to `mm/s` and `dm/s^2` to `mm/s^2` respectively. Additionally changed type from `uint32` to `float`.
```
mmc_client.Line.velocity
mmc_client.Line.acceleration
AutoInitialize.Line.velocity
AutoInitialize.Line.acceleration
Move.velocity
Move.acceleration
Push.velocity
Push.acceleration
Pull.velocity
Pull.acceleration
```

- **BREAKING:** Error and state enum definitions updated  
If you were using these error enums, they have been removed:
```
mmc.command.Request.Error.COMMAND_REQUEST_ERROR_CC_LINK_DISCONNECTED
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.info.Response.Command.Error.COMMAND_ERROR_DRIVER_DISCONNECTED
```
If you were using these carrier states, they have been removed:
```
mmc.info.Response.Command.Carrier.State.CARRIER_STATE_PUSH_COMPLETED
mmc.info.Response.Command.Carrier.State.CARRIER_STATE_PULL_COMPLETED
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.info.Response.Command.Carrier.State.CARRIER_STATE_MOVE_COMPLETED
```
The following error enums were added:
```
mmc.command.Request.Error.COMMAND_REQUEST_ERROR_INVALID_COMMAND
mmc.info.Request.Error.INFO_REQUEST_ERROR_COMMAND_NOT_FOUND
mmc.info.Request.Error.INFO_REQUEST_ERROR_INVALID_COMMAND
mmc.info.Request.Error.INFO_REQUEST_ERROR_INVALID_CARRIER
```

- **BREAKING:** Pull command target behavior  
Removed:
```
mmc.command.Request.Pull.Transition.axis
mmc.command.Request.Pull.Transition.location
mmc.command.Request.Pull.Transition.distance
``` 
Use instead:
```
mmc.command.Request.Pull.Transition.target
```
The behavior of `target` is equivalent to the previous `location` field.  
Additional change: Pass `NaN` to pull without motor-controlled transition.

- Release pipeline and artifacts updated
- API version handling merged into server message structure  
Removed:
```
mmc.core.Request.Kind.CORE_REQUEST_KIND_API_VERSION
mmc.core.Response.api_version
```
Use instead:
```
mmc.core.Request.Kind.CORE_REQUEST_KIND_SERVER_INFO
mmc.core.Response.Server.api
```

### Removed

- `VelocityMode` enum and related fields  
```
mmc.command.Request.VelocityMode
mmc.command.Request.AutoInitialize.Line.velocity_mode
mmc.command.Request.Move.velocity_mode
mmc.command.Request.Push.velocity_mode
mmc.command.Request.Pull.velocity_mode
```

- Documentation component `sabledocs`
